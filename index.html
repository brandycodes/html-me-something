                <p>Creative ex-freelancer and lifelong student pivoting to work in the tech industry. Currently excelling in LaunchCode's LC101 training course in Kansas City, Missouri. Actively seeking a front-end development apprenticeship for Spring 2018 in the area. I got my start with HTML and CSS back in the days of MySpace, using it to decorate my profile and run a fan website for a rock band I loved. After a while studying for my associate's degree in Administrative Assistant, caring for family, and attending engineering program at university, I found my way back to coding again. I am indoorsy and like working at a desk all day, and using my brainpower really hard to solve difficult, abstract problems. I am an intelligent person who also loves design and knows what color would look good right there. I enjoy how all those are blended in front-end development work.</p>
